                This website is dedicated to my work and personal projects.
                You can find some of them below, along with brief descriptions and ideas behind them.
                Everything else is available in my GitHub (link above).
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm currently a Master's student at University of Oulu, Finland. In my studies I specialize
                in applied computing. Besides that, I'm also interested in telecommunications, security in networks and cloud,
                virtualization and containers, and embedded things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking on new, interesting projects and participating in research are the two main things that keep me going. 
                That is probably why I've gained experience with a variety of tools and technologies, including Docker, Kubernetes, 
                Java, Python, React, NodeJS and C. I've done variety of things with each of these tools, such as web APIs with Flask
                 and NodeJS, and embedded development with C and MicroPython. For reference, you can check my GitHub. Of course, this is 
                not the full list of my abilities, and I hope to expand my proficiency with these tools and new ones in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my free time I like to tinker with different kinds of things related to Linux, Tor, and computers in general.
                I also enjoy nature a lot.
